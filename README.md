# Stupid bullshit unicorn

Just a playground for a small gosu project.  I'm more interested in exploring how game physics works with my kids than in making content for a playable game.

# Todo 

* Make physics stuff includable as modules.  It's almost there, but more confusing
* Grow unicorn when it eats donut
* Shrink unicorn when it poops donut
* Add donuts
* Play with collision detection. (idea: figure out if two moving objects will cross paths during a frame.  if they do, figure out when that could happen.  then calculate where those objects are at that time point.)
